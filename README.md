## <br> History

We felt this is an important feature that did not seem so complex.

Therefore we rolled up our sleeves and got to work on it. We came up with **alpha quite fast** and were one the first ones to publish plugins in the new marketplace.

## <br> The current state of the plugin

<br> But then came the **early adopters** with more and **more complex data** structures and specific use cases that made our heads hurt.<br> <br>

> We called in our top brains and made more improvements, things were still going great….

# <br> BUT

**BUT then we landed 2 amazing and very important projects.**

Our focus went elsewhere and we left the plugin for some time without open-source love.

# <br> **Open call for help and** **a bit of warning:**

This plugin is **really nice challenge for a senior developer** to really code and have some fun.

<br> Our senior developer Martin, the main author, is also available to answer your questions.

<br> Issues are coming and people are using it: take a look here [https://github.com/notum-cz/strapi-plugin-content-versioning/issues](https://github.com/notum-cz/strapi-plugin-content-versioning/issues)

<br> This could be you. Making this plugin great again.

# <br> <br> The future and possibilities

We believe this plugin may be in the marketplace’s top 5 most used plugins. But for that to become a reality we need fellow developers that would help and take it to the place it deserves to be.<br><br>

**_“Therefore this is an open call to all the companies as well as solo developers to help us with this plugin.“_**

We will happily do PRs and answer your questions.
